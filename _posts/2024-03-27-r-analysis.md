## Introduction

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revolutionized our understanding of genetic variations and their associations with complex traits. In this analysis, I explore the hierarchical approach using the hierGWAS framework, which offers a more structured and efficient way to analyze genetic associations.

## Key Objectives

- Implement hierarchical analysis in GWAS
- Evaluate genetic associations with complex traits
- Assess statistical significance and effect sizes
- Visualize genomic data and results

## Methodology

The analysis employs the hierGWAS approach, which incorporates hierarchical structures in genetic data to improve statistical power and reduce false positives. This method is particularly effective when dealing with large-scale genomic datasets.

## Analysis Overview

The complete analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and quality control
- Implementation of hierarchical models
- Statistical analysis and testing
- Visualization of results
- Interpretation and findings

## Detailed Results
