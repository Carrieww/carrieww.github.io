## Introduction

This notebook is a personal note I made when I first started learning GWAS. It's designed for beginners who are starting to explore GWAS or just getting into related research.

Since real GWAS datasets often are with restricted access because of the inclusion of raw genotypes and individual phenotypes, the `hierGWAS` package provides an example **toy dataset** called `simGWAS`, which is perfect for learning and practicing GWAS analysis.

For the complete analysis with step-by-step instructions, code implementations, and visualizations, please check out the full notebook:
